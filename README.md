# Analysis of Declining Marriage Trends

## Introduction
Marriage is an important cornerstone or milestone in someoneâ€™s life and their communities. It has been a decades-old tradition worldwide, with many believing that life remains incomplete without it. However, while marriages were traditionally encouraged or even enforced in some regions, modern times have seen a decline in marriage rates. With advancements in science and technology in this fast-paced era, fewer people are choosing to marry.

Marriage is a personal commitment, yet the declining trend suggests deeper societal changes influenced by:
- **Demographics**
- **Social factors**
- **Economic trends**
- **Cultural shifts**

This analysis explores the reasons behind this decline, shedding light on why fewer people are getting married compared to previous generations.

## Research Questions
The analysis aims to address the following key questions:
- How do socio-economic factors (e.g., income, education, urbanization, fertility rates) influence marriage rates?
- How have changing societal attitudes, such as single parenting, delayed marriage, and career priorities, affected marriage rates over time?
