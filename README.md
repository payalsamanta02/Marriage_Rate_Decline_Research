Introduction.
Marriage is an important cornerstone or a milestone in someone’s life and to their communities. Marriage has been a decades old traditions in every part of the world, some believe that without a proper marriage life remains incomplete. While traditionally marriage were encouraged or been forced in some parts of the world, now it’s completely different as we are living in a world of advanced sciences and technology in this fast moving era there have been fewer marriage compared to before. While marriages are a person’s personal commitment to life but when there is a declining trend there is something else that suggests this decline it could be the following.
•	Demographics
•	Social factors
•	Economic trends
•	Culture shifts
The reasons are not just limited to the above mentioned points, there could be many more reasons for people not get married.
A through a research analysis we can shed light on why fewer people are interested in getting married than before such that this can provide us with vital indicators.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
The analysis aims to answer the following questions:
•	How do socio-economic factors (e.g., income, education, urbanization, fertility rates) influence marriage rates?
•	 How have changing societal attitudes like single parenting, delayed marriage choices and priorities such as career development affected marriage rates over time?
Methodology
The data was sourced from well known data sources such as UN, Government website and open source data sources such World Bank. The data was cleaned and reformatted to be imported into the visualization tools that were used in this project.
In this project, I used 5 datasets from independent, reliable sources to analyze how socio-economic factors and societal attitudes shifts will influence marriage rates.

Data cleaning procedure
•	Data was cleaned and unnecessary rows and columns were removed such that curse of dimensionality does not effect the visuals.
•	Normalisation of the data was performed where there was a requirement such that there would be no inconsistent data overlapping.
•	Data was also transformed to better fit the visuals
Visuals Analysis
1.	Marriage Rate vs Human Development Index (HDI)
The dual-axis trend line visualization reveals an inverse relationship between marriage rates and the Human Development Index (HDI) over the years. The average marriage rate (orange line) shows a consistent decline, while the HDI (red line) steadily increases. This suggests that as countries develop, with improved education, healthcare, and economic stability, marriage rates tend to decrease.
Insights
1.	Higher HDI often correlates with societal shifts, such as greater emphasis on career and personal independence, which may lead to delayed or fewer marriages.
2.	Improved living standards and access to education for women could contribute to this trend by empowering individuals to prioritize goals beyond traditional societal norms.
 

2.	Marriage Rate vs Fertility Rate

In every marriage fertility is the most important factor for any couple or community. Fertility is having a strong relationship between marriages, a declining trend in fertility can indicate a declining trend in marriages.
 
The dual-axis trend line visualization illustrates the relationship between marriage rates (orange line) and fertility rates (blue line) over the years. Both metrics show a clear downward trend, indicating a strong correlation between declining marriage rates and fertility rates globally.
Insights
1.	The decrease in fertility rates may reflect shifts in societal values, such as delayed family planning, improved access to contraception, and changing priorities in education and career for women.
2.	The parallel decline suggests that traditional family structures associated with marriage may no longer be the primary driver of fertility in many countries.



3.	Global Trend of Urbanization vs Marriage Rate
This dual-axis visualization highlights the relationship between global urbanization (purple line) and marriage rates (orange line) over the years. While urbanization has been steadily increasing, marriage rates exhibit a consistent decline.

Insights
The rising urban population percentage reflects societal transformations such as increased mobility, education, and career opportunities, which are often associated with delays or declines in marriage rates.
Urban lifestyles may prioritize individual independence and financial stability, leading to shifting attitudes toward traditional family structures.
 

4.	Rise of Single Households (Single Parenting)
This line chart depicts the increasing share of single-parent households across different countries over time. The trend reveals a consistent rise in single-parent families globally, with variations in growth rates between countries.
Insights
1.	Countries like Nepal, Kenya, and Ghana show a significant increase in single-parent households, indicating evolving family structures.
2.	The trend may result from higher divorce rates, increased societal acceptance of single parenting, and changes in cultural norms.
3.	Economic independence, especially for women, might contribute to this rise, as individuals prioritize personal decisions over traditional family setups.
 

5.	Marriage for Same-Sex Partners (2019)
This map visualization categorizes countries based on the legal status of same-sex marriage: fully legal, partially legal, partially banned, or fully banned. The global distribution highlights the stark differences in societal and legal acceptance of same-sex unions.
Insights
1.	Countries in North America, Western Europe, and some parts of South America and Oceania have legalized same-sex marriages, reflecting progressive societal attitudes.
2.	In contrast, large regions in Asia, Africa, and parts of Eastern Europe still ban or restrict same-sex marriages, demonstrating significant cultural and political divides.
3.	This disparity underlines how societal attitudes toward marriage are influenced by local cultural norms, governance, and international advocacy efforts.

 

6.	 Average Age of Women for Marriage Increasing Across Many Countries
This line chart depicts the rising average age of women at marriage across various countries over time. Countries like Sweden, Norway, and the United States show a consistent increase in the average age, while others like Zimbabwe and Niger have lower rates of change.
Insights
1.	Developed nations (e.g., Sweden, Norway) exhibit a steeper increase in the average age at marriage, likely due to higher education levels, career priorities, and shifting societal norms.
2.	Developing nations (e.g., Zimbabwe, Niger) have a slower increase, reflecting cultural traditions and socio-economic constraints.
3.	The global trend of delaying marriage suggests a shift toward personal independence and financial security before committing to marriage.

 


7.	    Divorce Rate Increasing Trend Across Countries
This line chart shows the rising trends in crude divorce rates across multiple countries over the years. Countries such as Czechia, Portugal, and Finland exhibit significant increases, while others like Albania and Greece remain relatively low.
Insights
1.	Higher divorce rates in countries like Czechia and Portugal may reflect changing societal norms, greater financial independence, and relaxed legal constraints on divorce.
2.	Countries with lower divorce rates, such as Greece and Albania, may indicate strong cultural or religious influences that discourage divorce.
3.	This trend correlates with evolving societal attitudes towards marriage and family, emphasizing personal fulfillment and reduced stigma around divorce.

 

8.	  Correlation Between Marriage Rate and Average Years of Education
This scatter plot examines the relationship between marriage rates and the average years of education across countries. The trend line indicates a slight positive correlation, suggesting that higher average education levels may not directly deter marriage rates but could influence them in specific contexts.
Insights
1.	Education increases personal agency and career opportunities, which might delay marriage but does not necessarily lower overall marriage rates.
2.	The weak positive correlation could be due to cultural differences in how education and marriage are prioritized, as seen in countries with varying societal norms.

 


9.	  GDP per Capita vs Marriage Rate
This dual-axis chart compares GDP per capita (blue bars) and average marriage rates (orange line) over time. While GDP per capita shows a steady increase, marriage rates demonstrate a consistent decline.
Insights
1.	Rising GDP per capita indicates improved economic conditions, but this does not correlate with higher marriage rates. In fact, marriage rates decrease as financial stability improves, possibly due to shifting priorities such as career development and personal independence.
2.	Higher income levels may lead to delays in marriage, reflecting changing societal norms in economically developed regions.

 
Conclusion
1.	Socio-economic factors like GDP per capita, Average no of years of education levels, and urbanization significantly correlate with declining marriage rates. For example, higher urbanization levels often accompany shifts toward individualistic lifestyles, delaying or reducing marriages.
2.	Changes in societal attitudes, including declining fertility rates, increasing average age at marriage, and acceptance of diverse family structures, have also contributed to declining marriage trends.



Justification
•	Financial independence and higher education influence individuals to prioritize careers and personal growth over traditional milestones like marriage.
•	Urbanization encourages alternative lifestyles and reduces the traditional societal pressure to marry.
•	Legal recognition of non-traditional unions(same sex marriages) reflects changing societal values.

Future Research Questions
1.	How does the cost of raising children influence marriage and fertility decisions?
2.	How do economic recessions or booms affect marriage rates in both developed and developing nations?
